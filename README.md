##Browser Interface for the Roland-MODELA

A browser-based interface for quickly sending Eagle PCB designs to the Roland-MODELA milling machine.

This version requires being run on a Window's PC, with the Roland-MODELA drivers already installed. Using the MODELA without any drivers requires further research. Please contact me if you have any helpful information on this.
